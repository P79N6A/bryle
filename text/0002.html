    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When I was in Mother Goose, they respected my choice and didn't put me in journalism, from the day you told me I was in debate, I immediately said no, thinking you wouldn't put me there since I denied. Why is it that you forced me to join debate, when you know I said no? Did it seem like I was kidding when I said "nonononononononononononononononono"? I said no many times, and yet I was forced into a contest I didn't want to join and didn't want to be part of. I just wanted one, single, measly contest that I want to join in, and that is the spelling bee. Nothing else.</p>
